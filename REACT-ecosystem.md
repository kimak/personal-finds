        > Flexbox works the same way in React Native as it does in CSS on the web, with a few exceptions.
 The defaults are different:

        - flexDirection defaulting to column instead of row 
        - alignItems defaulting to stretch instead of flex-start
        - the flex parameter only supports a single number.

                > React Native Android is based on Fresco for loading and displaying images. Downsampling is disabled for PNGs in React Native, since it is still experimental. So, we have started using JPG images whenever possible.

    - Animation
        - Slow page transition

            > We started scheduling the animation using the InteractionManager. While making the transition, we load lesser content and render the remaining content, once the transition is complete. It helped us provide a smoother experience to our users.

    - Could i code background tasks in javascript with ReactNative ?
        > No.

        > Unfortunately, these things can't be done with Javascript alone. So, you need to explore the bridges provided by React Native. Swift for iOS, and Java for Android; for the development of background tasks.
